## Accelerated NLP
**Core topics**
- Classical and neural language models; n-gram baselines to transformer LMs
- Attention and transformers (BERT, T5, GPT-style pretraining and adaptation)
- Reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought prompting and structured decomposition
- Scaling laws and practical implications for training/inference
- Post-training: instruction tuning and preference optimization (e.g., RLHF-style pipelines)

## Probabilistic Modelling and Reasoning
**Core topics**
- Probabilistic graphical models (Bayesian networks, factor graphs)
- Exact inference in structured models (DAGs, HMMs)
- Decision-making under uncertainty and causal reasoning basics
- Latent variable models; variational inference; VAEs
- Monte Carlo methods and sampling-based approximations

## Programming for Data Science at Scale
**Core topics**
- Data-parallel programming models and distributed data-parallel systems
- Sparse processing and performance considerations at scale
- Optimization of distributed pipelines (compute, memory, communication)
- Distributed query processing and graph processing foundations

## Current subjects
- Advanced Topics in Machine Learning
- Machine Learning Systems
- Methods in Causal Inference
