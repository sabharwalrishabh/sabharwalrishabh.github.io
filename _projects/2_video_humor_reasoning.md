description: Dataset + benchmarking for culturally grounded humor reasoning in Indian video contexts.
importance: 2
category: datasets
---

Developed **Indic-SMILE**, a dataset for generating plausible reasons behind humor in short video clips.

- Extracted **audio, visual, and textual** features for multimodal reasoning.
- Benchmarked VLMs/LLMs (e.g., InternVL3, VideoLLaMA3, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Claude Sonnet, Gemma-3, Sarvam-M) to evaluate cultural alignment in Indian contexts.
- Focus: measuring whether models produce *plausible, culturally grounded* explanations rather than generic captions.
